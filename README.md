OVERVIEW

This delivery app project, developed by a team of four, aims to streamline the delivery process for users, drivers, and admins. Through the app, users can create accounts, log in, and request drivers to deliver items to specified locations. The app also includes:

User-friendly features for seamless interaction.

Admin functionalities for efficient data management.

Real-time delivery tracking for accurate updates.


PURPOSE

With the rising demand for efficient delivery solutions, our app aims to bridge the gap between users and drivers by offering a reliable and convenient platform for deliveries. This project embraces the power of technology to provide a modern and convenient delivery solution for users and drivers alike.

PROJECT GOAL

The app’s core purpose is to provide users with an easy way to:

Register and login

Request deliveries to specific destinations

Track deliveries in real-time The admin panel offers centralized management of delivery requests and driver data.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS

Flutter: For cross-platform development.

Firebase: Real-time database and authentication. 

Balsamiq Mockups: Interface sketching.

Visual Paradigm: UML modeling.

Android Studio: Emulator and IDE for Flutter development.


HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS

The app is compatible across smartphones, tablets, and PCs, ensuring accessibility for a broad user base. Minimum requirements include:


Android devices: 2GB RAM and 16GB storage.

Apple devices: iPhone 6s or later, iPad Air 2+.

PCs: 64-bit processor with at least 4GB RAM.


KEY FEAUTURES

User Registration and Authentication: Securely store user details and passwords.

Delivery Request System: Users can request deliveries by specifying pickup and drop-off locations.

Driver Assignment: Based on proximity and availability.

Admin Control Panel: Admins can monitor and manage requests and data stored in Firebase.

Real-time Tracking: Keep users updated with delivery statuses.

SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

The app uses a client-server model:

Client-side: User interface in Flutter.

Server-side: Firebase database, handling user and driver data and real-time updates.

APIs: Facilitating communication between client and server for seamless data flow.
Technologies Used

Languages: Dart, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Frameworks: Flutter for mobile app, Firebase for backend.

Database: Firebase NoSQL database for real-time data handling.

Modeling Tools: Balsamiq and Visual Paradigm.


DATABASE DESIGN

Core Collections:

Users: Stores personal details, authentication, and roles.

Requests: Stores delivery requests, pickup/destination, status, and timestamps.

Accepted and Rejected Requests: Tracks status and relevant user/driver data.
Security

User passwords are encrypted (e.g., bcrypt), and Firebase handles authentication, enforcing strict data privacy.


SETUP AND INSTALLATION

Install Dependencies: Ensure Flutter and Firebase are set up.

Run Emulator: Use Android Studio’s emulator for testing.
